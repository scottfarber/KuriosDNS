# KuriosDNS
Docker setup with chain of DNS privacy tools

Forked build from KuriosDNS customized for my QNAP NAS

replace ${PIHOLE_WEBPASS} with your desired pihole admin password

replace BOTH instances of ${SERVERIP} with the IP address of your QNAP NAS

replace ${PIHOLE_VHOST} with your desired pihole FQDN

ports modified due to QNAP listening on most standard ports needed for the original build
